# Nostr Python Learning

This is just some simple code to help me learn how to connect and use nostr from python. The techniques are the same though no matter what language. I am using some helpful libraries tha makes this signficiantly easier, but most of the difficulty comes from the crypto used behind the scenes, so I'm using the [nostr](https://github.com/jeffthibault/python-nostr) python library for that side of things. Sadly it seems this library is no longer maintained, but it has all the basics we need to get started super fast and easy.
